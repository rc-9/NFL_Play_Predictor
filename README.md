## About The Project


The purpose of this project was to explore tree-based ensemble methods to assess the performance and efficiency of these algorithms when applied to a classification problem. 
Specifically, we targeted three techniques with varying levels of complexities: a basic decision-tree, a general gradient-boosting algorithm, and an extreme-gradient boosting algorithm (XG-Boost).
The objective for each method was to accurately predict NFL plays (run, pass, field-goal, punt) based on attributes such as game-time remaining, yardage information, score-differential, and time-out availability.
